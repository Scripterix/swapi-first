<h1>Specification SWAPI Planets</h1>


<h3>List of Planets</h3>

<p>Write an application that presents a list of planets. Data should be requested from an external server. Use this
  service - https://swapi.co/api/planets/. You may choose in what way you wish to present the list, as long as it is
  pleasing to the user’s eye.</p>

<p>The application should have a search bar located at the top of the list. A user should be able to type a string
  phrase
  into the search input and the planet list should be filtered by their names.</p>

<p>The list presented should also contain pagination with an option to navigate to different pages in addition to
  another
  option in order to select the page size (possible values should be 5, 10, 25, 100).</p>

<p> user should also have an option to view the details of their selected planet. Clicking on a planet should navigate
  the user to a page where the details of the planet are presented. At the top of that page should be a ‘back’ button
  that navigates back to the list. Navigation should be possible by changing only the URL.</p>

<p>Prepare your own design for the application, not forgetting to make it as user friendly as possible. In case of
  problems with availability of API, prepare a JSON file populated with mock/dummy data (architecture has to
  be written to easy switch to API) </p>
